      <h3> About This Banana</h3>
      <div class="product">
        <p>Sweeter and creamier than regular bananas, red bananas have a rich, berry-like flavor with a hint of vanilla. Their reddish-purple peel and soft, nutrient-packed flesh make them a delicious and unique treat. Enjoy them fresh, in smoothies, or as a naturally sweet addition to your favorite recipes!</p>
