      <h2>About This Banana</h2>
      <div class="product">
        <p>
          Regular bananas are a popular and versatile fruit known for their
          smooth, yellow peel and naturally sweet, creamy texture. They are rich
          in essential nutrients like potassium, vitamin B6, and fiber, making
          them a healthy and energizing snack. Bananas can be enjoyed fresh,
          blended into smoothies, baked into desserts, or used in a variety of
          dishes. Their mild flavor and soft consistency make them a favorite
          choice for people of all ages.
